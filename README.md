# 100 Days of Code 
It's a challenge that aims to gain code practice and enhance programming knowledge. 
## Day #1 Create a Band Name Generator
**It's actually a pretty basic exercise to understand string manipulation and input function. You have two inputs which contain city and pet name , and  to create a band name , you have to put two of them together.**
## Day #2 Tip Calculator
**This project is mostly about mathematical operators. It’s a useful project to calculate the bill per person if you’re bad at math :) . In addition to the bill , there’s a tip which you must add to the bill to calculate the total amount of the bill. Then, you can calculate the bill per person by dividing the total amount of bill by the person to split.**
## Day #3 Treasure Island
**This is a fun game to play . You have to find treasure to win the game, but it's not easy. You must be careful because there are lots of traps. It helps us to understand ,that the basis of if/else statements. Also I added a island view that called ASCII ART .  [For more ASCII ART you can visit :](https://ascii.co.uk/art)**
## Day #4 Rock Paper Scissors
**This classic “rock paper scissors” game is all about the if/else conditions in this program. You’re playing against the computer :) It’s kinda exciting !!! For better UI, I added ascii arts that represent rock, paper ,and scissors.**
## Day #5 Password Generator
**The Password Generator project contains two levels : easy ,and hard. We retrieve 3 inputs called hm_letters , hm_numbers ,and hm_symbols that decide how many numbers of them(letter,number,symbol) that the user wants in their passwords. Ex: 3 letters, 4 numbers ,and 1 symbol. With these values, you have to create a password considering the inputs *“respectively”* . Ex: sel2626@ . It’s the easy level ,but the hard level aims to randomise the order of characters. Ex: (assume the number of inputs are the same) s26@e6l2**
## Day #6 The Hangman Game
**In this project I created 3 files: hangman_stages (for stages of hangman ), main, wordlist (for alphabet). I could use all of them in one file but separated them into 3 because it's more readable. I used if conditions to control lives and printed the stages that represent the lives . Lastly, I checked if there is a ‘_’ symbol . If there is, that means the user couldn’t finish the game ,but if there is not, that means the user predicted all letters in the word before the man hung :)))**
## Day #7 CaesarCipher
![caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher#/media/File:Caesar_cipher_left_shift_of_3.svg)

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence. For more information about Caesar cipher: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)

  

This project’s main aim is to encode and decode messages. Also , with the while loop you can encode or decode messages as much as you wish :)))

  

Ps: I added the alphabet into the alphabet list twice because of the “out of range” error.
## Day #8 The Secret Auction Program
**This program aims to find the highest value in the dictionary called ‘d’ :). In the dictionary you’re matching names with bid amounts. For example {“selen”: 789, “nazlı”: 564} , then you have to find who has the highest bid . I casted dictionary to the list to use the “max” function :) Then with the max value’s index I got the winner's name.**
## Day #9 Calculator
**I defined a functions to each transaction and match them with the operator symbols (‘+’ ,‘-’,’ /’ ,‘*’ ). I got two inputs from the user and asked for the transaction that the user wanted(I did that in a while loop so the user didn't need to end the program to calculate a new transaction) . In the end all of these I printed the result :  print(f"{result} {operation_symbol} {next_num} = {next_result}") Example result = 12 + 5 =17 
**Also , you can use the previous answer: 12 + 5 = 17 (choose to continue)17 - 7 = 10 …****
