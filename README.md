# 100 Days of Code 
It's a challenge that aims to gain code practice and enhance programming knowledge. 
## Day #1 Create a Band Name Generator
**It's actually a pretty basic exercise to understand string manipulation and input function. You have two inputs which contain city and pet name , and  to create a band name , you have to put two of them together.**
## Day #2 Tip Calculator
**This project is mostly about mathematical operators. It’s a useful project to calculate the bill per person if you’re bad at math :) . In addition to the bill , there’s a tip which you must add to the bill to calculate the total amount of the bill. Then, you can calculate the bill per person by dividing the total amount of bill by the person to split.**
